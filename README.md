Javascript Koans
======

## Overview

JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence. 

The inspiration for this project comes from the [Edgecase Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/) and the book '[Javascript: The Good Parts'](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-good/9780596517748/).

## Getting Started

Open the file [jskoans.htm](jskoans.htm) in your favourite browser and make the tests pass by editing the files located in the `topics` directory

## Further Information

The koans use the [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/) test syntax and test runner.
